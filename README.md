## Simplified Flappy Bird

* Bird at x = 0. Move up and down with buttons. Movement limited at edge.
* 1 moving wall. Wall spawns at right edge of screen. Random hole position.
* Detect collision:
  * bird flies frontally into wall
  * bird flies vertically into wall while flying through hole
* Count crossed walls.


## Ideas for extension

* 2nd wall
* make bird and wall easier to distinguish visually
* lives
* dynamic game speed
* gravity
* broadcast highscore to other Micro Bits
* use rotation (pitch) to control bird
